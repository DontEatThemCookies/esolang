# David Costell's Esoteric Languages

An esoteric language is a programming language not intended for serious, real-world applications, but instead as an exercise to test the limits and boundaries of a programmer's creativity and uniqueness, or just as one large joke. This repository is a collection of esoteric language implementations, such as Brainfuck. In the future it will also contain original esolangs.

[The Esolang Wiki](https://www.esolangs.org/) is a good place to learn about esoteric programming.

Current Languages:
* Brainfuck (MIT)
* Super Stack! (WTFPL)
