# David Costell's Esoteric Languages

An esoteric language is a programming language not intended for serious, real-world applications, but instead as an exercise to test the limits and boundaries of each programmer's creativity, or just as one large joke. This repository is a collection of esoteric language implementations, such as Brainfuck. This repository's works are licensed under the terms of the MIT License.
