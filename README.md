# David Costell's Esoteric Languages

An esoteric language is a programming language not intended for serious, real-world applications, but instead as an exercise to test the limits and boundaries of a programmer's creativity and uniqueness, or just as one large joke. This repository is a collection of esoteric language implementations, such as Brainfuck. It also includes some original esolangs.
