# David Costell's Esoteric Languages

An esoteric language is a programming language not intended for serious, real-world applications, but instead 
as an exercise to test the limits and boundaries of a programmer's creativity and uniqueness, or just for 
laughs. This repository is a collection of esoteric language implementations, such as Brainfuck. In the near
future, it may contain original esolangs, although I'd probably make separate repos for that. I'll link to
the repository here if that happens.

[The Esolang Wiki](https://www.esolangs.org/) is a good place to learn about esoteric programming.

Current languages:
| Language    | Description      |   
| ----------- | -----------      |
| Brainfuck (RBFI)               | A normal Brainfuck interpreter. That's all.          |
| Brainfuck 4 Humans (bf4h)      | A Brainfuck derivative made ~~in jest~~ for humans.  |
| Deadfish Interpreter           | A normal Deadfish interpreter.                       |
| Super Stack! for Python3       | A (half-assed) "port" of User:Orange's Super Stack!  |

Fair warning: that repo's older code is of my beginner self, when he absolutely butchered Python.
It gets better the newer you look though.
